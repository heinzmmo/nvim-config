# My Neovim Configuration

I mainly use it for **C, Python, and LaTeX** projects. Some parts are messy, and I tweak things as I go.

## Acknowledgment
Much of this configuration is inspired by and adapted from [neovim-kickstart-config](https://github.com/hendrikmi/neovim-kickstart-config).
Big thanks to the original author!
